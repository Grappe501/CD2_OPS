## Audience
- Volunteers (including elderly / low tech)
- New staff
- Partner org leaders

## The promise
> “You can contribute in under 60 seconds without learning a system.”

## Script (live demo, 5 minutes)
1) Show the dashboard: “This is where leadership sees the truth.”
2) Click the **+ Quick Add** button:
   - submit one voter question
3) Show where it appears (Narrative dashboard widget)
4) Go to Discord:
   - type `/question`
   - submit modal
5) Show audit explorer:
   - show actor attribution (requires linking)

## Minimum training checklist
- [ ] Can open CD2_OPS URL
- [ ] Can click “+ Quick Add”
- [ ] Can type one sentence and hit Save
- [ ] Can type `/question` in Discord and submit
- [ ] Knows where to ask for help

## Common failure points (and fixes)
- “I can’t find the button” → it’s always bottom-right
- “I don’t know what to type” → literal words, one question per entry
- “Discord doesn’t show commands” → commands not registered / wrong channel perms
- “Audit says unknown” → link Discord user to CD2 user in Admin → Discord Linking
